                JayPlus is a specialized business management software designed for auto detailing businesses. As the
                creator, I've embarked on a journey to make it a comprehensive suite of tools to facilitate
                administrative and operational activities in this domain.
            </p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>

                <li>Maximizing profit margins</li>
                <li>Facilitating data-driven managerial decisions</li>
            </ul>

                <li>Marketing resource kits (planned for future releases)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Version 1.0 Development Plan</h2>

            <h3>Technical Architecture</h3>
            <strong>Backend:</strong> A service-oriented monolithic architecture.<br />
            <strong>Frontend:</strong> Independently deployed client applications.

            <h4>Frontend Development</h4>
            <p>
                The frontend of JayPlus is built using React and TypeScript. There are two main applications: The Admin
                Interface (focused on booking management functionalities) and the Customer Interface (primarily centered
                around service scheduling capabilities).
            </p>

            <strong>Technologies Utilized:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>React</li>
                <li>TypeScript</li>
                <li>React Router DOM</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Backend Development</h4>
            <p>
                For the backend, Go is the programming language of choice. The system is designed in a way that
                segregates functionalities into domain-specific packages. The primary database in use is Postgres.
            </p>

            <p>For version 1.0, our attention is concentrated on:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Booking functionalities</li>
                <li>User Authentication</li>
            </ul>

            <strong>Technologies Utilized:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Go Programming Language</li>
                <li>Postgres Database</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                The system also integrates REST API endpoints for communication between the frontend and backend, and
                uses JWT for secure authorization and authentication.
            </p>

            <h3>Features</h3>
            <strong>Customer Booking:</strong> This feature enables customers to schedule their services in a three-step
            process. Post selection, they are redirected to the payment page. After successful payment, they receive a
            receipt with all relevant details. <br /><br />
            <strong>Booking Process:</strong> The booking process is comprehensive, with clear options for vehicle type,
            service type, and date-time selection. <br /><br />
            <strong>Admin Panel:</strong> Designed for easy navigation, the admin panel allows business administrators
            to manage bookings efficiently. This interface has been optimized for all devices, ensuring a seamless
            experience regardless of the screen size.

            <h3>Frontend App Structure</h3>
            <p>
                The frontend application, crafted using React, follows a clean and organized structure. It's divided
                into two main sections: CustomerApp and AdminApp. Each section has its set of functionalities and
                routes, ensuring an optimized user experience.
            </p>

            <h3>Backend App Overview</h3>
            <p>
                The backend of JayPlus is modular and domain-driven. It ensures efficient data management and smooth
                operations. The application integrates several services, including core services like the App Service,
                DB Service, and Auth Service. It also includes business logic services such as the Booking Service and
                Payment Service, and utility services like the SMS Service.
            </p>

            <p>
                In conclusion, building JayPlus has been a learning journey. As the software evolves, the vision remains
                clear: to offer the best administrative and operational tools for auto detailing businesses. Stay tuned
                for more updates as we progress towards future releases!

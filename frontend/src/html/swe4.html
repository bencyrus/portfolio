            <h1>Journey of Building JayPlus: A Business Management Software for Auto Detailing</h1>
            <p>
                An overview of the JayPlus software, its goals, features, and the technologies utilized in its
                development.

            <p>
                When I began the overhaul of JayPlus, I was crystal clear on my vision. I diligently penned down a
                comprehensive specification document that meticulously listed the required routes, frontend components,
                and everything in between. It seemed straightforward: with such detailed specs, execution should be a
                breeze, right? Reality had other plans.
            </p>
            <h3>The Dual Nature of Specification Documents:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The Good: Specification documents are an invaluable asset. They force you to encapsulate the
                    entirety of your system. At times, they act as a foolproof blueprint, guiding you to build exactly
                    what you've envisioned.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Twist: However, there are instances when these documents merely act as a stepping stone. If
                    you're charting unfamiliar waters - for instance, trying out new tools or techniques - like my dive
                    into creating a service-oriented monolithic application in Golang, you might veer off from your
                    initial specifications. This is even truer when starting a project entirely from scratch, which was
                    the scenario with JayPlus.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>The Evolution of Software and Specification Alignment:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Presently, JayPlus is a well-defined system with clear styles, models, folder structures, and
                    integrated modules. Now, if I were to draft a specification document, the final output would mirror
                    it almost precisely.
                </li>
                <li>
                    However, these documents aren't a one-size-fits-all solution. For a nimble team, say in a fledgling
                    startup, crafting detailed specs for every bug fix could be overkill. Yet, they become indispensable
                    when laying the foundation for new implementations, like analytics. They serve as a proactive
                    measure against accumulating tech debt and offer a sandbox to test ideas without immediate
                    execution.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>The Goldmine in Application Rewrites:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    When you're rewriting an app, you're not venturing into the unknown. Armed with frontend designs or
                    even Figma prototypes, specification documents can become your North Star. They help crystallize the
                    visualization of elements ranging from the DOM tree to intricate state management.
                </li>
                <li>
                    As for the backend, with the groundwork of JayPlus behind me, I had a bird's-eye view of all
                    required endpoints. This clarity empowered me to strategically lay out handlers, plot integration
                    points, and ponder over system-level architectural considerations.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>In Conclusion:</h3>
            <p>
                Specification documents are a potent tool, but they're not infallible. If your journey deviates from the
                laid-out path, it's not a sign of their failure or yours. These documents are there to navigate, not to
                shackle. And at times, they might inadvertently lead you astray. This is especially pronounced when your
                architectural roadmap and style are still in flux. So, use them wisely, but always be ready to embrace
                the unexpected twists they might unveil.
